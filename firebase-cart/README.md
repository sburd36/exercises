# Firebase Cart Exercise

This app will let users search iTunes for tracks, which they can then add to a shopping cart. The cart data is maintained on Firebase. The iTunes searching part is already implemented for you, but you need to implement the add/remove/render parts of the shopping cart. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` once in this directory to install all of the modules this application depends upon. The `firebase` module is already listed as a dependency, so this will install that module as well.
1. Using the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new Firebase application
1. Enable the Anonymous Sign In Method
1. Copy/paste the Firebase config and `firebase.initializeApp()` call into `src/index.js`
1. Implement the `TODO:` comments in `src/App.js`
1. Run `npm start` to compile your application and start the auto-reloading development server
