    result of calling Date.now() when the timer is started. 
    This value is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed
    between Jan 1, 1970 and the moment when Date.now() was
    called. Call Date.now() again in this function and
    then subtract state.startTime from the result to get the
    number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the timer
    was started. Then convert that into a number of minutes
    and seconds. There are 1000 milliseconds in one second,
    and there are 60 seconds in one minute. For example, if
    62000 milliseconds have elapsed, you should covert that
    into 1 minute and 2 seconds. If the number of milliseconds
    doesn't divide evenly into seconds, use Math.floor() to
    round down to the previous second.

    After you calculate the elapsed minutes and seconds,
    set the text content of the <span class="minutes">
    element to the number of minutes, and the text content
    of the <span class="seconds"> element to the number of
    seconds.

    FYI: the reason we are storing a start time in the state
    rather than the number of elapsed seconds is because
    timer functions in JavaScript are not guaranteed to run 
    exactly at the interval you request. JavaScript is single-
    threaded, so if the interpreter is busy running other code
    when your timer fires, it will wait to run your timer function
    until the current code execution finishes. If you merely
    increment an elapsed number of seconds during your timer
    function, you'll quickly experience clock skew.
